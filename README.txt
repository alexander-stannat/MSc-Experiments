I performed some experiments to analyse agent interactions in the P2P file sharing application Tribler.

Tribler is an onion-routing based file sharing network, which aims to to increase its efficiency by applying mechanisms of indirect reciprocity, known as accounting mechanisms to induce cooperation in the network.

In my thesis I investigated properties accounting mechanisms should satisfy in order to successfully enhance the Tribler network and and be resistant to attacks on the network, such as Sybil attacks.
